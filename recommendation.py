##Recommendation based on medical condition
cnv = """**For CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization)**:
- **Recommendation**: 
    - **Immediate Referral**: Seek prompt evaluation by a retinal specialist. CNV is often associated with conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can lead to significant vision loss if left untreated.
    - **Treatment Options**: 
      - **Anti-VEGF Therapy**: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections such as Ranibizumab or Aflibercept are commonly used to halt or slow the progression of CNV.
      - **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**: In some cases, photodynamic therapy may be used alongside anti-VEGF injections.
      - **Laser Treatment**: Though less commonly used now, laser therapy may be recommended in certain situations.
    - **Lifestyle and Monitoring**: 
      - **Diet**: A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin) can help support retinal health.
      - **Supplements**: Consider supplements such as AREDS2 formulation for patients with AMD.
      - **Regular Monitoring**: Repeat OCT scans every 1 to 3 months to assess response to treatment and progression of disease.
    - **Next Steps**: 
      - Schedule immediate follow-up with a retina specialist.
      - If receiving anti-VEGF injections, expect regular treatments initially, with the frequency tapering as the condition stabilizes.

dme = '''**For DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)**:
- **Recommendation**:
    - **Endocrinology Consultation**: In addition to ophthalmic care, close coordination with an endocrinologist is essential to manage systemic diabetes, which directly impacts the progression of DME.
    - **Treatment Options**: 
      - **Anti-VEGF Injections**: Similar to CNV, anti-VEGF therapy is the first-line treatment to reduce retinal swelling and improve vision.
      - **Corticosteroid Implants**: In cases where anti-VEGF is less effective, intravitreal steroid injections or implants may be considered.
      - **Laser Photocoagulation**: Focal or grid laser therapy may be used to treat areas of leakage, especially in non-central-involved DME.
    - **Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure Control**: 
      - **Strict Glycemic Control**: Keeping HbA1c levels below 7% is crucial to slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.
      - **Blood Pressure Management**: Hypertension worsens DME; aim to maintain a blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg.
    - **Monitoring**:
      - **Frequent Eye Exams**: Patients with DME require regular OCT scans (every 3 to 6 months) to monitor fluid accumulation and treatment response.
      - **Diabetes Management**: Tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure levels will help prevent future episodes of macular edema.
    - **Next Steps**: 
      - Schedule a visit with both your retina specialist and endocrinologist.
      - Begin or continue anti-VEGF treatment as needed, and ensure systemic conditions are tightly managed.

  '''

drusen = '''**For Drusen (Early AMD)**:
- **Recommendation**:
    - **Dietary Changes**: 
      - **High in Antioxidants**: Incorporate foods rich in vitamins C, E, zinc, copper, and beta-carotene, which can help slow the progression of AMD. Spinach, kale, and fish rich in omega-3s are beneficial.
      - **Supplements**: The **AREDS2** (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2) formulation is recommended for patients at moderate to high risk of progression to advanced AMD.
    - **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
      - **Quit Smoking**: Smoking greatly increases the risk of AMD progression and should be avoided.
      - **UV Protection**: Wear sunglasses with UV protection to reduce retinal damage from harmful sunlight exposure.
    - **Monitoring**:
      - **Regular OCT Scans**: For early AMD or drusen, repeat OCT imaging every 6 to 12 months to track changes in retinal structure.
      - **Amsler Grid Monitoring**: Use an Amsler grid at home to self-monitor for sudden vision changes, such as wavy lines or blank spots, which could indicate progression to wet AMD.
    - **Next Steps**:
      - Discuss AREDS2 supplements and lifestyle changes with your healthcare provider.
      - Schedule routine OCT scans to monitor drusen size and any potential advancement of AMD.

  '''

normal = '''**For Normal Retina**
- **Recommendation**: 
    - **Routine Eye Care**: While your OCT scan shows a normal retina, itâ€™s essential to maintain regular eye exams, particularly if you have risk factors like a family history of retinal diseases.
    - **Eye Health Maintenance**:
      - **Balanced Diet**: Continue a diet rich in nutrients that support eye health, such as dark leafy greens, fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, and foods rich in antioxidants.
      - **Sun Protection**: Wear sunglasses with UV protection to minimize the risk of retinal damage from sunlight.
    - **Next Steps**:
      - If you have no symptoms or vision problems, follow up with routine eye exams as recommended by your ophthalmologist (typically every 1 to 2 years).
      - Maintain general health practices, including managing conditions like diabetes or hypertension that could affect retinal health.
